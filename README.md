KEYWORDS:
#Computation:

Computation is driven by the CPU (Central Processing Unit), GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), and ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits). These components form the backbone of data processing and number crunching in both personal and enterprise computing environments.

Hardware

Hardware includes the physical components that make up a computer system. From the memory (RAM) and storage devices to semiconductors that drive the computational logic, hardware plays a vital role in computing.

Storage

In computer science, storage is the process of capturing and preserving digital information on storage media. Storage can be used in many places, including offices, data centers, remote locations, and mobile devices.

Fullstack Development

A Fullstack developer is proficient in both frontend and backend technologies. This combined skill set allows developers to create fully integrated web applications.

Networking:

#3.1 Local area network (LAN): A LAN covers a small geographic area suvh as a home, office or campus.

#3.2 Wide Area Network (WAN) :

A WAN spans a large geographic like multipke cities or countries.

#3.3 NIC (Network Interface Card)

A network interface card (NIC) is a hardware component, typically a circuit board or chip, installed on a computer so it can connect to a network. Modern NICs provide functionality to computers, such as support for input/output interrupt, direct-memory access interfaces, data transmission, network traffic engineering and partitioning.

Operating Systems

An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. Kernel: The core part of the OS that manages system resources. OS Layer: Abstracts hardware resources for higher-level software. Applications: Programs that run on top of the OS. CISC & RISC: Two primary CPU instruction set architectures. Virtual Machine: An emulation of a computer system.

Bare Metal

Bare metal refers to a physical computer server that's dedicated to a single user, or tenant. It can also refer to a computer's hard disk, or a virtualization environment that runs without a host operating system.

Ethernet

Ethernet is a wired computer networking technology that allows devices to communicate with each other over a local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), or wide area network (WAN).

Virtual Machine

A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based computer that functions like a physical computer, but exists within another computer's operating system. In cloud computing, VMs are used to virtualize the resources of cloud service providers' servers. This allows multiple customers to share resources, which is known as multi-tenant cloud architecture.

Virtualization and Cloud

Virtualization allows multiple operating systems to run on the same physical hardware, facilitated by a hypervisor. The cloud enables on-demand availability of computing resources.

Blockchain abd Cryptocurrencies

Blockchain technology records and confirms cryptocurrency trades, like a digital ledger. It collects and stores information about buying, selling, or exchanging digital assets. This information exists without a central authority (such as a bank) overseeing or controlling the cryptocurrency market.

Programming and Development

Compiler: Converts high-level code into machine code. Interpreter: Executes code line by line. Algorithms: Step-by-step procedures for solving problems. Data Structures: Ways to organize and store data efficiently. DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms): Crucial for performance optimization in software development.

Open Source

Open source refers to software whose source code is made available to the public for anyone to view, use, modify, and distribute. This model promotes collaboration and transparency, allowing a community of developers and users to contribute to the software’s development and improvement.

Closed Source

Closed source software, also known as proprietary software, is software whose source code is not made available to the public. Instead, the source code is kept secret by the software's developers or the company that owns it. Users are granted access to the software through licenses but do not have the ability to view, modify, or distribute the source code.

VPN

Virtual Private Network, is a technology that creates a secure and encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet. It allows users to send and receive data as if their devices were directly connected to a private network, enhancing security and privacy.

DNS

Domain Name System, is a fundamental component of the internet that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network. Without DNS, users would have to remember and enter numerical IP addresses to visit websites, rather than simple and memorable domain names like www.example.com.

IP

An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. IP addresses serve two main functions:

Identification: They uniquely identify a device on a network, ensuring that data is sent to the correct destination. Location Addressing: They provide the location of a device in the network, which helps in routing data packets across the internet.

RISC-V

RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) based on the principles of Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC). It was designed to be a simple, modular, and extensible ISA, making it a versatile and adaptable choice for a wide range of computing applications.

CISC

CISC is a type of microprocessor architecture that aims to reduce the number of instructions needed to perform a task by providing a large set of complex instructions. CISC architectures are designed to execute multi-step operations with a single instruction, which can help simplify programming and reduce the number of instructions per program.

DSA

DSA stands for Data Structures and Algorithms, which are fundamental concepts in computer science and software engineering. Understanding and applying DSA effectively is crucial for designing efficient and scalable software. Here’s a breakdown of these concepts:

Data Structures- Data structures are specialized formats for organizing, managing, and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

DBMS

DBMS stands for Database Management System, which is a software system that provides an interface for interacting with databases. A DBMS manages and organizes data, supports data manipulation and retrieval, and ensures data integrity and security. It serves as a bridge between users and the database, handling data storage, queries, updates, and administration.

Linker/Loader

Linker is a software tool that combines multiple object files generated by a compiler into a single executable file. It resolves references between object files and ensures that all code and data are properly connected. Here’s how it works:

Semiconductors (ICs)

Semiconductor chips (also known as integrated circuits or ICs) are crucial components in modern electronics. They consist of multiple semiconductor devices (such as transistors, diodes, and resistors) integrated onto a single piece of semiconductor material, typically silicon. These chips are used in a wide variety of applications, from simple gadgets to complex computing systems.
